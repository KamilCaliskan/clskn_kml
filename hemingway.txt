Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist.
His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, 
while his adventurous lifestyle and public image brought him admiration from later generations. 
Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, 
and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. He published seven novels, 
six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, 
four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. 
Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.

Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, 
he was a reporter for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for 
the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. 
In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. 
His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).
